1. Do I have to paste my key everywhere?, isn't that unsafe?
2. Why can't I create subkeys or rotate my key?
3. How do I lend my key so others can sign with it on my behalf?
4. Nostr is centralized because everybody will just use the same big relays! 
5. If there is no Blockchain, no DHT, no central directory then how do I find out in which relay a given key is publishing their events to?
6. Nostr doesn't have discovery!
7. Nostr is a nazi bar because we can't censor bad actors, criminals, spammers, scammers, stalkers, harassers!
